# freq.py
Mark Baggett's (@MarkBaggett - GSE #15, SANS SEC573 Author) Awesome-Sauce tool for detecting randomness using NLP techniques rather than pure entropy calculations. Uses character pair frequency analysis to determine the likelihood of tested strings of characters occurring based upon the chosen frequency tables (some prebuilt English text freq tables provided). Extremely useful for detecting high entropy where it shouldn't be. Especially powerful for discovering DNS based DGAs commonly used for malware C2 and exfiltration. Think bigger than DGAs though. Random file names, script names, process names, service names, workstation names, TLS certificate subjects and issuer subjects, etc.
